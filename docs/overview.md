# Overview

warcraftsim trains agents on the real Warcraft III 1.29, headless under Wine. Python steps the game every half second of game time. The project reimplements nothing.

## Status

| track | best result | run |
|---|---|---|
| Micro fights | 91% against the scripted opponent. League self-play: 82%, and 79% against the 91% policy. | `--trainer torch` |
| Whole game, `duelrush` (2-minute games) | **79%** against the built-in AI, all 16 matchups. | `fgself-10` |
| Whole game, `duelfast` (6-minute games) | **80%** of its games against the insane AI won. Every matchup is above the AI's own record. | `fgself-51` |
| **The real game on Echo Isles** (the game's rules, no handicap) | **~77% of its games against the insane AI won** (~1,900 evaluation games): ~150% of the AI's own record on Echo Isles. Human ~48%, undead ~63%, orc and night elf ~95%. | best `fgself-73`, `fgself-77` running |

The yardstick is the evaluation games: the real game against the built-in AI, which the policy does not train on. Each policy in a run plays the same matchups (paired), so a run compares its policies directly.

## Next (2026-10-17)

1. `fgself-77`: a quarter of the KL to the anchor. The gradient noise measurements show a clean pull to the anchor and a very noisy policy gradient. This can hold each new run at its start.
2. A strategy for each game: a target build order and unit mix, with a small reward to follow it, so that the policy also techs. Human replays add more strategies: build orders from any game version, demonstrations from 1.29's.
3. A main exploiter (`fgself-76`) did not help: it never beat the main policy in 70% of its games.

[The road to the real game](road-to-the-real-game.md) has the details.

## How we make a whole-game agent

```

* A clone of the built-in AI is the start. Reinforcement learning then improves on it.
* The KL term keeps the policy near an anchor. The anchor moves to a recent checkpoint as the policy improves.
* The policy now beats its teachers. The advice and the cloning loss from the built-in AI are off.
* Each experiment is a new run, forked from the best checkpoint. It starts with its parent's league.
